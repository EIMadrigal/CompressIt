Mid-Autumn Festival

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Mid-Autumn Festival (traditional Chinese: 中秋節; simplified Chinese: 中秋节; pinyin: zhōngqiū jié) is a popular harvest festival celebrated by Chinese and Vietnamese people. The festival is held on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar, during a full moon, which is in September or early October in the Gregorian calendar, close to the autumnal equinox.

The Government of the People's Republic of China listed the festival as an "intangible cultural heritage" in 2006, and it was made a Chinese public holiday in 2008. It is also a public holiday in Taiwan. Among the Vietnamese, it is considered the second most important holiday tradition. The day following Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday in Hong Kong and Macau (the festival day itself is not a holiday in Hong Kong and Macau, the logic is that most celebrations are held at night).
